# Selenae  
**Selenae** is a comprehensive salon platform built to bridge the gap between salons, customers, and vendors. It allows **salons to register**, showcase their **services** and **products**, while **customers** can explore nearby salons, book services, and purchase salon-related products. Vendors can also participate by managing and offering their inventory to salons.

This platform is crafted using modern technologies like **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, **Redux Toolkit with RTK Query**, and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a seamless and responsive experience for all users.
