          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services provided by GlowVita ("we,"
          "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl mt-10">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using our website, mobile application, or beauty and wellness booking services, you agree to be bound by
          these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our
          services.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl mt-10">2. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will provide notice by posting the updated Terms
          on our website and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of our services after the changes take
          effect constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl mt-10">3. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>
          To access certain features of our services, you may need to register for an account. You agree to provide
          accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to
          keep it accurate, current, and complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your
          account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl mt-10">4. Booking and Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          When you book an appointment through our platform, you are entering into an agreement with the salon or
          service provider, not with GlowVita. We act as an intermediary to facilitate the booking process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellation policies vary by salon. Please review the specific cancellation policy for each salon before
          booking. Generally, cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment time may be subject
          to a cancellation fee.
        </p>
